    "\n",
    "### 1) Data Analysis: What Height is Telling You\n",
    "\n",
    "Your visual analysis reveals that height is a high-variance, high-leverage feature with specific botanical constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The \"Grass vs. Clover\" Paradox:** Height acts as a physical filter for species composition. Tall plots ( cm) are almost exclusively dominated by upright species like Lucerne or Phalaris, whereas Clover is structurally confined to the lower canopy. This is why `Dry_Clover_g` shows a negative Spearman correlation (); height isn't just a biomass measure, it's a species indicator.\n",
    "* **The Monotonic Saturation Point:** The gap between Spearman () and Pearson () for `Dry_Green_g` suggests that while taller grass always means more biomass, the *rate* of increase slows down or becomes more erratic at high values. This \"saturation\" means a linear model will overestimate biomass at the very top and underestimate it in the mid-range.\n",
    "* **Decoupling of Dead Material:** The near-zero correlation () for `Dry_Dead_g` confirms that canopy height is a \"live-only\" metric. Dead biomass is likely hidden at the base of the canopy (under the \"height\" line) or is a result of senescence that doesn't add to vertical stature.\n",
    "* **Heteroscedasticity (Spread Increases with Height):** As height increases, the \"cloud\" of points in your scatter plots spreads out significantly. This means your prediction error is naturally higher for tall samples, which will disproportionately penalize your  if not handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Training Data Strategy: Tail-Aware Split & Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard random splitting will cause the model to fail on the high-biomass samples because they are mathematically \"outliers\" but economically the most important.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Height-Stratified Binning:** Instead of splitting by index, divide your height distribution into \"Strata\" (e.g., 0–10cm, 10–25cm, 25+cm). Ensure your validation and test sets have a proportional representation of that sparse 25–70cm tail to ensure the model's  is representative of all growth stages.\n",
    "* **Tail-Heavy Oversampling:** In your training loop, the model sees 0–10cm samples 80% of the time. You must artificially increase the frequency of high-height samples (oversampling the tail) so the model learns the \"heavy\" physics of tall Lucerne or Phalaris plots.\n",
    "* **Species-Balanced Height Sampling:** Ensure that for every height bin, you have a mix of species. If the model only sees Lucerne at 50cm, it will learn a \"Lucerne-only\" biomass mapping for tall plants, failing on other tall species-mixes.\n",
    "* **Weighting by Target Importance:** Since your weighted  prioritizes `Dry_Total_g` (0.5) and `GDM_g` (0.2), your sampling strategy should favor samples with high total mass, even if their height is moderate, to maximize the metric that matters most.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Modeling Approach: Heavy-Tail Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Because height and biomass are heavily skewed (as seen in your boxplots and histograms), standard regression techniques will struggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Non-Linear \"Head\" Architecture:** Given that , the relationship is monotonic but not linear. Using a non-linear activation (like ReLU or Softplus) specifically for the height input before it merges with image features allows the model to learn the \"power-law\" curve of plant growth.\n",
    "* **Robust Loss Functions (Beyond MSE):** Mean Squared Error (MSE) squares the residuals, meaning an error on a 70cm sample (high biomass) will influence the weights 100x more than an error on a 5cm sample. Switching to **Huber Loss** or **Log-Cosh Loss** makes the model more robust to the \"long tail\" outliers seen in your boxplot.\n",
    "* **Log-Space Optimization:** While you noted `log1p` doesn't change the ordering, it drastically improves the \"loss surface\" for the optimizer. Training on `log1p(target)` and `log1p(height)` compresses the 0–175g range into a 0–5 range, preventing gradient explosions and allowing the model to focus on percentage errors rather than absolute gram errors.\n",
    "* **Multi-Task Uncertainty Weighting:** Treat the 5 targets as separate tasks but let the model learn which ones are \"noisier\". Since `Dry_Dead_g` is essentially random relative to height, the model should learn to \"down-weight\" its influence on the shared backbone features so it doesn't degrade the high-signal `Dry_Green_g` prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to elaborate on a specific strategy for the **Dry_Dead_g** target since height is not providing a useful signal there?"
