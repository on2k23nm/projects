    "### **Project Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to design, train, and evaluate a **multi-task computer vision system** that can **simultaneously predict Age, Gender, and Race** from a single face image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than treating these as independent problems, the project formulates them as a **joint inference task**. A shared convolutional backbone is trained to learn a common facial representation, while task-specific heads specialize in predicting each attribute. This approach reflects real-world deployment scenarios, where multiple attributes must be inferred from the same input under strict fairness and generalization constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project aims to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learn a **shared facial representation** that supports all three tasks without sacrificing individual task performance.\n",
    "* Minimize demographic bias by enforcing **balanced evaluation across race, gender, and age groups**.\n",
    "* Ensure statistically sound performance measurement using **identity-disjoint train/validation/test splits**.\n",
    "* Validate generalization on unseen populations via a strict hold-out test set.\n",
    "* Produce a **deployment-ready model**, with inference exported to ONNX and exposed through a REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is not limited to model training; it emphasizes **end-to-end system design**, spanning dataset selection, data engineering, multi-task learning, fairness evaluation, and production-oriented deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Dataset Selection & Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.1 Formulation of Evaluation Criteria**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the abundance of publicly available face datasets, this project begins with a structured audit:\n",
    "**Which dataset best supports a global, equitable facial analysis system?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this, I defined the following evaluation criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Demographic Parity:** Balanced representation across 7 race groups (White, Black, Indian, East Asian, Southeast Asian, Middle Eastern, Latino) to reduce bias.\n",
    "* **Label Granularity:** High-fidelity, concurrent labels for **Age**, **Gender**, and **Race**.\n",
    "* **Environmental Diversity:** Images captured “in-the-wild” with real-world variation in lighting, pose, and background.\n",
    "* **Scale:** Sufficient volume ($>100k$ images) to support generalization.\n",
    "* **Generalization:** Support for **balanced accuracy**, where performance is independent of race and gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Model Development Pipeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1 Data Engineering & Stratified Splits**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.1.1 Data Partitioning Strategy: Ensuring Unbiased Generalization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the source dataset provides predefined training and validation splits, this project adopts a more rigorous **three-way split** (Train / Validation / Test) to ensure statistically sound evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A custom data pipeline is used to re-partition the combined image pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.1.2 Rationale for the Three-Way Split**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many public benchmarks—including **FairFace, CelebA, and UTKFace**—do not provide a true held-out test set tailored to a custom pipeline. However, a deployment-ready system requires a strict separation of concerns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Training Set:** Used to optimize model parameters.\n",
    "* **Validation Set:** Used for hyperparameter tuning and architectural decisions.\n",
    "* **Test Set:** A final, untouched “black-box” set used only once to measure real-world generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.1.3 Methodology: The Re-Splitting Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "To preserve statistical rigor, the following workflow is applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Consolidation:** Original training and validation splits are merged into a unified pool.\n",
    "* **Stratified Re-Splitting:** The pool is re-split into Train / Val / Test while preserving identical distributions across:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 7 race groups\n",
    "  * 2 genders\n",
    "  * 9 age bins\n",
    "* **Identity Disjointness:** No individual appears in more than one split, preventing identity leakage.\n",
    "* **Independence Verification:** Ensures unbiased evaluation, as test images never influence training or model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2.2 Multi-Task Model Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is formulated as a **multi-task learning system**, where a single shared representation supports multiple prediction objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2.2 Shared Backbone: The “Master” Feature Finder**\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the architecture is a **ResNet-34 CNN** used as a **shared feature extractor** for all three tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of training separate networks for age, gender, and race, the model first learns a strong, general-purpose **face representation**, which is then reused by task-specific heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Input:** Preprocessed face images.\n",
    "* **Output:** A compact embedding capturing facial structure, texture, and shape.\n",
    "* **Benefit:** Since all tasks backpropagate through the same backbone, the learned representation generalizes across labels instead of overfitting to a single task.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.2.2.1 The Input–Output Handshake**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before implementing task-specific logic, a strict contract is defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Input:** A batch of face images resized and normalized to $(B, 3, 224, 224)$.\n",
    "* **Output:** A 512-dimensional embedding per image.\n",
    "* **Shape Guarantee:** A batch of size $B$ produces an output tensor of shape $(B, 512)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This contract ensures that downstream heads can be attached cleanly and independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.2.2.2 Surgery: Turning a Classifier into a Feature Finder**\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard ResNet-34 is trained to classify 1,000 ImageNet categories. These final class predictions are not useful for facial attribute learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Operation:** The final classification layer is removed.\n",
    "* **Stopping Point:** The network is truncated after the **Global Average Pooling** stage.\n",
    "* **Cleanup:** The pooled tensor $(B, 512, 1, 1)$ is flattened into a clean $(B, 512)$ embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "This transforms ResNet-34 from an object classifier into a reusable feature extractor.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.2.2.3 Training Strategy: Let the Backbone Learn**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the baseline model, the backbone is **fine-tuned**, not frozen.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Full Gradient Flow:** All backbone parameters remain trainable.\n",
    "* **Shared Learning Signal:** Errors from age, gender, and race predictions all update the same representation.\n",
    "* **Result:** The backbone learns facial features that are broadly useful across tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2.2.2.4 Trust-but-Verify Sanity Checks**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before large-scale training, two sanity checks validate correctness:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shape Check:** A dummy input must produce exactly a 512-dimensional embedding.\n",
    "2. **Gradient Check:** A backward pass must propagate gradients into backbone parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "These checks ensure the backbone is actively learning and not acting as a frozen observer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2.3 Training Evaluation on Test Set**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section represents the final, unbiased evaluation of the trained system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Test Set** is a strict hold-out: it is never used during training or validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3.1 Unseen Data Benchmark**\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model is evaluated on the held-out test split to measure generalization to previously unseen faces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3.2 Multi-Task Performance Breakdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance is reported independently for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Age Classification**\n",
    "* **Gender Classification**\n",
    "* **Race Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis verifies whether the shared backbone supports all tasks equally well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3.3 Fairness & Slice-Based Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy is evaluated across demographic slices (e.g., per-race accuracy) to detect residual bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3.4 Error Analysis via Confusion Matrices**\n",
    "\n",
    "Confusion matrices are used to visualize systematic errors, such as confusion between neighboring age bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3.5 Identity Leakage Verification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Final checks confirm that no subject identities overlap between training/validation and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3.6 Comparison to Commercial Baselines**\n",
    "\n",
    "Results are benchmarked against industry-standard commercial APIs to contextualize performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2.4 Deployment & Inference (ONNX + REST API)**\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate real-world applicability, the trained model is prepared for deployment:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ONNX Export:** The PyTorch model is exported to ONNX for framework-agnostic inference.\n",
    "* **Inference Engine:** ONNX Runtime is used for efficient CPU/GPU inference.\n",
    "* **REST API:** A FastAPI-based service exposes a `/predict` endpoint for age, gender, and race inference.\n",
    "* **Parity Checks:** Outputs from ONNX inference are verified against PyTorch to ensure numerical consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step bridges the gap between research and production-ready systems.\n"
